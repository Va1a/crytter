	<p>The exchange rates sidebar displays updated exchange rates as provided by <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/about"><u>Coinbase</u></a>.</p>
	<p>JavaScript must be enabled in the browser for rates to display. Rates update every 30 seconds, without the need for a page refresh.</p>
	<p>The exchange rate of a currency reflects the current price, in US dollars, of that currency.</p>
	<p>Rates increase as demand / perceived value of a currency increases, and decrease if the opposite happens.</p>
	<p>Similarly, offers display their current <a href="{{ url_for('main.help', topic='deal-value') }}"><u>deal value</u></a>.</p>
