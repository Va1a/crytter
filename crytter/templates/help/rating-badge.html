	<hr>
	<p>A rating badge is a universal signifier of a user's reputability, present anywhere their username is.</p>
	{% if current_user.is_authenticated %}<p><i>Your rating badge looks like this: </i>{{ current_user.rateBar|safe }}</p>{% endif %}
	<p>As your reputability changes (every 20 points or so) your rating badge will also change.</p>
	<p>Because rating badges are visible everywhere, it is important to maintain a positive reputability score.</p>
