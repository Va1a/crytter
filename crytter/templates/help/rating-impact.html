	<p>Your rating impacts other users' reputability.</p>
	<p>Reputability is the most important information on any user. It determines how credible a user is based on past deals they have done with others.</p>
	<p>A negative reputability is an indicator of discredible tendencies, and will result in a warning displayed on all of a user's offers as well as their profile.</p>
	<p>The impact your specific rating has on another user's reputabiltiy varies based on how much reputability you yourself have. For example, if you have 25 reputability, your rating impact will be +/- 2 reputability points (depending on if you rate positively or negatively).</p>
	<p>A user's reputability also determines what <a href="{{ url_for('main.help', topic='rating-badge') }}"><u>Rating Badge</u></a> they have.</p>
